Check Your Server Configuration Files
This is where many 405 errors hide. The two most common web servers are Apache and Nginx, and they use different configuration files. You will need to access your site’s files via FTP, SSH, or your hosting provider’s file manager.

For Apache Servers (.htaccess)
Apache uses a file named .htaccess to manage configurations on a per-directory basis. This file can contain rewrite rules or security directives that might be blocking HTTP methods.

Locate the .htaccess file: It’s usually found in the root directory of your WordPress installation (the same folder that contains wp-config.php).
Back up the file: Before making any changes, download a copy of your .htaccess file to your computer.
Inspect for problematic rules: Open the file in a text editor and look for RewriteRule or RewriteCond directives that might be interfering with requests. Security plugins often add rules to this file. Look for lines that contain flags like [NC,F,L] where the F flag means “Forbidden,” which can cause a 405 error. Also, look for any rules that might be redirecting POST requests in a way that turns them into GET requests.
Test with a default file: A simple way to check if your .htaccess file is the problem is to temporarily replace it with a default one. For WordPress, the default .htaccess file looks like this:
# BEGIN WordPress

RewriteEngine On

RewriteRule .* – [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

RewriteBase /

RewriteRule ^index\.php$ – [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

RewriteRule . /index.php [L]

# END WordPress

Rename your current .htaccess file to something like .htaccess_old and create a new file named .htaccess with the default content above. Then, try to reproduce the error. If the error is gone, you know the problem was in your original .htaccess file. You can then copy rules from your old file back into the new one, one by one, until the error reappears to find the culprit.
For Nginx Servers (nginx.conf)
Nginx does not use .htaccess files. Its configuration is handled in a central nginx.conf file, which is typically located in /etc/nginx/. Editing this file usually requires root access to the server.

Locate the nginx.conf file: The exact location can vary, but it’s often in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf or /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-site.
Inspect the configuration: Look for location blocks that define how Nginx handles requests for specific URLs or directories. Check for any directives that might be causing the issue. A common mistake is a location block that only allows GET requests. You might see a line like error_page 405 = @405_error; which defines a custom action for 405 errors. The key is to ensure that the configuration allows the necessary methods (like POST) for the scripts that need them.
Consult your hosting provider: If you are on a managed hosting plan, especially one like Elementor Hosting that is optimized for a specific application, you might not have direct access to the Nginx configuration. In this case, your best bet is to contact their support team. They can review the server configuration for you and identify any rules that might be causing the 405 error. An optimized hosting environment often prevents these kinds of misconfigurations from happening in the first place.
