Dedw3n Advertisement Terms of Service

The following terms of service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Dedw3n Advertisement program (“Dedw3n Advertisement”, the “Program”, or the “Service”) by Dedw3n Ltd. and its subsidiaries as applicable (collectively, “Dedw3n” or “we”).
 
Please read these Terms carefully before you start using Dedw3n Advertisement. By using Dedw3n Advertisement, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by the Terms, incorporated herein by reference. If you do not want to agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Service. These Terms are supplemental to Dedw3n.com’s general Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”), which also apply to Dedw3n Advertisement. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings given to them in the Terms of Service.
 
1. Dedw3n Advertisement

The Dedw3n Advertisement Program allows qualified Sellers to promote their business by making their services visible as Advertisement in prime locations in the marketplace (the “Advertisement”), within certain categories. Dedw3n Advertisement uses a first-price auction mechanism to determine the cost and placement of Advertisement from participating Sellers. In Dedw3n Advertisement, Sellers pay a fee only when Buyers click on the Sellers’ Advertisement. Dedw3n Advertisement is available for qualified Sellers who meet various quality metrics and are not found to be in violation of the Terms of Service and/or Dedw3n’s Community Standards. 
 
2. Bids

A bid is the highest amount the Seller is willing to pay for one click on their Dedw3n Advertisement' Ad. Higher bids may increase Sellers’ chances of winning auctions; however, other metrics—such as relevancy or quality (the likelihood of views, sales, etc.)—are also taken into consideration for determining the service's “Ad rank”, which ultimately determines the auction winners.
 
Please note that the highest bid does not necessarily win the auction. High-quality services may win auctions with lower bids (while maintaining the highest Ad ranks). Under no circumstances does the Program constitute a guarantee or obligation by Dedw3n to promote your services. Furthermore, we cannot promise that an Ad will be clicked, nor that if the Ad is clicked, that the Dedw3n Ad will be purchased. Should you win an auction, the placement of your Dedw3n Ad, if any, will be subject to Dedw3n’s sole choice and discretion. Bids are subject to minimum amounts set by Dedw3n in advance.
 
3. Auction

Dedw3n Advertisement are based on a “First-Price Auction” process, which means that while the service with the highest Ad rank wins, the price that the Seller will be charged for each click (Cost-Per-Click) is based on the bid for the winning Ad, and calculated automatically by Dedw3n.

4. Advertisement Location

Locations of Advertisement on the Site are based on a variety of factors, including the bid amount, the quality of the service, relevance, and others, and in any event, are subject, at any time, to Dedw3n’s sole discretion.
 
5. Daily Limit

The daily limit is the maximum amount a Seller is willing to pay in a single day to promote their services. Sellers are required to define a daily limit in order to turn on Dedw3n Advertisement. A day, for this purpose, is defined as a calendar day in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
 
Please note that there is no guarantee that the entire daily limit will be used on any day. The daily limit may be updated by the Seller at any point, with effect no later than the next business day.
 
6. Payment Terms

Dedw3n Advertisement' fees are charged on a monthly basis, during the first week of each calendar month, based on the clicks made in the previous month. By default, the fee is charged from the Seller's Dedw3n Credits and/or Dedw3n Balance (if there are not enough Dedw3n Credits). However, when there are no sufficient funds in the Seller's Dedw3n Balance, the remaining fee will be charged from the payment method defined by the Seller in their account, or deducted from the Seller’s future earnings if no payment method is defined.
 
Sellers may be charged with indirect taxes (such as Sales Tax, VAT, or GST) depending on residency, location, and any applicable law, in addition to the fee which was calculated in the auction process. Please note that the daily limit set by the Sellers does not include any and all taxes. 
 
For all other terms, please read the Purchasing section in our Terms of Service.
