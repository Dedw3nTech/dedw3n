Dedw3n Learn: Terms of Service
Last Updated: April 2025
The following terms of service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Learn from Dedw3n platform (“Learn from Dedw3n” or the “Site”), which is owned and operated by Dedw3n International Ltd. (“Dedw3n,” also referred to as “we” or “our”).
Please thoroughly review these Terms prior to utilizing Learn from Dedw3n. By accessing or using Learn from Dedw3n, you acknowledge and consent to be legally bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy, accessible here, which is incorporated by reference. Should you disagree with these Terms or the Privacy Policy, you are required to cease access or use of the Site. These Terms supplement Dedw3n.com’s general terms of service, accessible here (the “Terms of Service”), which are also applicable to Learn from Dedw3n.
Learn from Dedw3n acts as a digital marketplace for online courses across various disciplines (the “Courses”), available exclusively to Dedw3n users. All Courses are developed and delivered by independent instructors (the “Instructors”). Dedw3n disclaims responsibility for the content, quality, or academic level of the Courses and does not assure the accuracy or completeness of any information provided by the Instructors. We recommend users to employ our rating system for selecting Courses.
As a service provider, we do not inspect Courses for legal compliance or assess the legality of their content. Your participation in any Course and its associated materials is at your own risk, and you accept full responsibility for any actions taken post-engagement with a Course.
1. Copyright Infringement
Instructors affirm that all content included in their Courses is original and does not violate any third-party rights, including copyrights, trademarks, or service marks. Where music or stock footage is utilized, Instructors must confirm possession of a valid license for such media.
Dedw3n will respond to precise and complete notices of alleged copyright or trademark infringement. Our Intellectual Property claims procedures can be reviewed here.
2. Third-Party Websites
Courses on Learn from Dedw3n may include links to third-party websites not owned or controlled by Dedw3n. Accessing third-party websites is done at your own risk. Dedw3n disclaims liability for any damage or loss incurred from using or relying on information, materials, products, or services obtained through third-party websites. Users should thoroughly review the terms and conditions of each third-party service provider.
3. License
Upon registration for a Course, Instructors grant you a restricted, non-transferable right to view the Course and its related materials for personal, non-commercial use. You are prohibited from distributing, transmitting, assigning, selling, broadcasting, renting, sharing, modifying, creating derivative works of, or otherwise transferring or utilizing the Course.

4. Payment
Courses require advance payment, exclusively via credit card. For additional payment terms, refer to the purchasing section in our Terms of Service here. Applicable indirect taxes (such as sales tax, VAT, or GST) may apply based on your residency and relevant laws.
5. Refunds
If dissatisfied with a Course, contact us via the Contact Us page. Refund requests are accepted within 30 days of purchase.
Please Note: Completion of a Course disqualifies you from a refund. Users with repeated purchase and refund behavior may face suspension for abusing the refund policy.
Refunds generally process within 7 -12 business days, although they may take up to 30 days to reflect in your account. If over 10 business days have passed since processing, contact your bank directly for updates.
For programs with multiple Courses, refunds are only available for incomplete Courses, calculated as the program’s total price minus the completed Courses’ full price.
6. Promo Codes
We may offer promo codes for Course and program discounts. To apply a promo code, enter it at checkout. Promo codes are non-combinable with other promotions, subject to expiration, non-refundable, and hold no cash value. Dedw3n reserves the right to modify or cancel promo codes at any time.
7. Course Badges and Benefits
Upon successful Course completion, a badge will display on your Seller page. This badge enhances visibility in the marketplace, as Course completion contributes to professional skills.
“Successful Completion” involves viewing all video content, completing all exercises, and independently finishing the final exam and/or quizzes.
