When and how are commissions disbursed?
The Dedw3n Affiliate Program facilitates payments via direct deposit to your bank account or through PayPal in most countries. To initiate a withdrawal, affiliates must first accumulate a minimum balance of £1 GBP. Participants have the option to receive payments either upon reaching a specified balance or on a bi-weekly basis. It is important to note that Dedw3n credits commissions to your account balance only once a month, specifically on the 29th, for referrals made in the preceding month, regardless of your chosen withdrawal frequency.
Understanding the Dedw3n Affiliate Commission Timeline
Step I: Locking Period
Upon selection of a vendor account, your referral enters a 28-day locking period. During this timeframe, the affiliated partnership team conducts a thorough review of each referral to confirm their compliance with the eligibility criteria for commission.
Step II: Payment
Once the locking period concludes, your referral becomes eligible for payment. Payments are processed the day following the end of the locking period..
