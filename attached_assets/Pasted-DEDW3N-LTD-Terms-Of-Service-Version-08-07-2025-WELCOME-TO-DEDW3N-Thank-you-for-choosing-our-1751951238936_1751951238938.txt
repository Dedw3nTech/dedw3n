This includes differences in size, color, or severe damage (such as stains, odors, or holes), or if an item is missing from a bundle.  
- The item is identified as a counterfeit SNAD.
Reporting Issues:
If you encounter any issues with the item, you must report it by clicking the “Contact Us” page within two calendar days from the date you are notified of delivery or if the item appears to be lost (the "Refund Request Period"). Reporting within this timeframe will suspend the transaction, and all funds will remain in escrow until the issue is resolved. Failure to report an issue within the Refund Request Period will result in the transaction being marked as completed.
Handling SNAD Items (excluding counterfeit items):
We recommend discussing the issue with the seller first to reach a mutually agreeable resolution. If a resolution cannot be achieved, you may escalate the matter to us. If you report an item as SNAD within the Refund Request Period, we will notify the seller. The seller may choose to:  
- Grant a refund without requiring the return of the item, or  
- Request the item’s return within five business days in order to issue a refund. You will be responsible for return shipping costs unless otherwise agreed with the seller.

In the latter case, your funds will remain in escrow until the issue is resolved. If you purchased items as part of a bundle, you may return only the SNAD items.
Seller Response Time:
If the seller does not take action within 14 days of your report, or if either party raises an issue at any time during the process, customer support will make the final determination regarding the SNAD status of the item.
Handling SNAD Counterfeit Items:
If you report an item as a SNAD counterfeit within the Refund Request Period, we will investigate the claim by gathering information from both you and the seller to reach an objective decision.  
- If the item’s authenticity is confirmed, the transaction will be completed, and the funds will be released to the seller.  
- If we lack sufficient information to determine if the item is counterfeit, we will classify the case as ambiguous, cancel the transaction, refund you as outlined below, and require you to return the item at your own expense (unless otherwise agreed with the seller).  
- If there is compelling evidence that the item is a SNAD counterfeit, we will notify the seller, who will have 24 hours to provide evidence of authenticity. If they fail to do so, we will cancel the transaction, and you will not need to return the item to obtain a refund.
Escalating Issues:
Should you escalate an issue to us, we will review your case and may request information and evidence from both you and the seller to facilitate an objective decision regarding eligibility for a refund under our policy. Both parties agree to respect the final decision.
