Escrow Account
The total price will be held in a separate escrow account managed by a Dedw3n Wallet Provider until the transaction is completed.

To the extent permitted by law, we Dedw3n disclaim any liability for inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated tracking information. Delivery times will vary based on the carrier selected. We retain the right to add, suspend, or remove carriers at any time.
Lost or Damaged Parcels

Listing an Item: To list an item for sale on the Site, you must take and upload a photograph and provide a description (neither of which may be sourced from the internet) that accurately represents the item's quality and appearance, including any defects or alterations. This must also comply with applicable laws regarding product safety and compliance, including mandatory information about the manufacturer or economic operator, labelling, and marking of products. Once your item is listed in the Catalogue and published on the Site, it constitutes an official offer for sale, which a Buyer may accept.  
Buyer's Choice: If a Buyer submits a counteroffer with a new price for an item, the item is not considered sold upon your acceptance of that counteroffer. The Buyer retains the option not to purchase your item even after you agree to the counteroffer. An item is officially sold only when a Buyer clicks the purchase button and their payment is accepted.  
Withdrawing Your Listing: You may withdraw a listing at any time prior to a Buyer purchasing the item.  
Hidden Mode: You have the option to apply a “Hidden” mode to your Business account, which will conceal your items from Users.

- Include all legally required information regarding pre-sale and sale, unless this information is provided to the Buyer in another appropriate manner.  
- Provide complete and accurate information concerning your address, professional references, and contact details.  
In the event of a contradiction between your Business Vendor Policies and these Business Terms, the stipulations in these Business Terms will prevail.  
Invoices: You are responsible for issuing an invoice to the Buyer for the item sold and any shipping services resold to them through the Site.  
Additional Services: You may opt to purchase other optional services (such as those designed to enhance your item’s visibility to Buyers). We will inform you of the costs associated with each service and the duration of access prior to purchase. Each optional service is a one-time automated service and cannot be transferred between items or Users. Payment can be made using one of the methods outlined under “How to Pay on Our Site.” An email confirmation will be sent following your purchase.  
Buying an Item from a Business Vendor  
How to Purchase an Item: To acquire an item from a Business Vendor, you must:  

- Click the purchase button.

- Click the payment button on the checkout page.

- Acknowledge that the information on your account is accurate.  
Order Confirmation: You will receive an email confirming that your order has been accepted and payment has been processed. The Business Vendor is required to ship the item within five business days of purchase; otherwise, the transaction will be automatically cancelled. We will receive updates from the carrier and notify you regarding the expected delivery date or if the item appears to be lost.  
Purchases Outside of Our Site: If you purchase an item offline or outside of our Site, we assume no responsibility for that transaction. Such purchases are made at your own risk and will not be covered by the protections we offer for transactions conducted on our Site.  
Your Right of Withdrawal
Understanding the Right of Withdrawal/Cancelation: If you are classified as a “consumer” under Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights and purchase an item from a Business Vendor, you possess a legal right to return the item for a refund should you change your mind (the Return Right).  
Exceptions to the Right of Withdrawal: The Return Right is not applicable under certain legal exceptions, including:  
- Items customized to consumer specifications or clearly personalized.  
- Items likely to deteriorate or expire rapidly.  
- Sealed items unsuitable for return due to health or hygiene reasons that have been unsealed after delivery.  
- Items that are, by nature, inseparably mixed with other items post-delivery.  
- Sealed audio or video recordings or sealed computer software that have been unsealed after delivery.  
Exercising Your Right of Withdrawal: You have 14 calendar days from the delivery date to return the item. If the 14th day falls on a weekend or public holiday, you may return it on the next working day. To initiate the return process, you can:  
I. Send “I have an issue” in your private message with the Business Vendor.  
II. Include your  withdrawal form when returning the item.  
III. Provide any clear statement to the Business Vendor indicating your desire to return the item.  
Returning the Item: Ensure to use tracked delivery and retain the tracking number. Generally, you are responsible for return shipping unless the Business Vendor Policy states otherwise. In certain circumstances, you may not need to return the item (for instance, if there is compelling evidence that the item is counterfeit).  
Responsibility of Business Vendors: If you exercise your Return Right through channels other than the 'I have an issue' button as described, your interactions will be directly between you and the Business Vendor, and we will not be liable for the Return Right.  
Refund Process: Refunds will be issued using the same payment method employed for the purchase:  
- Once the Business Vendor agrees to refund you without requesting the item back, or  
- Once the Business Vendor confirms receipt of the item and its condition. We will then instruct the Dedw3n Payment Provider to process your refund. If the Business Vendor does not notify us within 14 days of your proof of dispatch or receipt of the item, we will investigate the issue. The transaction will be suspended, and the total price will remain in escrow until a determination is made regarding your refund.  
Additional Rights and Protections
Legal Guarantee of Conformity: By law, Business Vendors are accountable if an item does not conform to its description in the Catalogue or the order, regardless of whether the defect is obvious or concealed. You should address any defects directly with the Business Vendor, as they bear responsibility in this regard, not Dedw3n.  
Responsibilities  
- Data Shared with Us: While we implement measures to protect personal data, Content, and other information you share, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not bypass these measures. You acknowledge that providing personal data is done at your own risk, and we suggest that you take appropriate precautions to safeguard your data or software, particularly against potential viruses.  
- Tax Liabilities: We are not responsible for any tax liabilities or reporting obligations that may arise from your activities on the Site or transactions you conduct.  
- Force Majeure: In the event of unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of either party, that party will not be held accountable for failing to meet obligations under these Business Terms until the situation resolves.

We, along with Dedw3n Affiliates and/or our licensors, retain all intellectual property rights associated with the Site, including its system, layout, software, trademarks, and domain names.  
Information Presentation: To enhance User experience, we may reorganize the Catalogue, advertising spaces, or other information on the Site. Such changes will not affect the Content you provide or our obligations under these Business Terms.  
Service Interruptions: We may partially suspend the Site or our Services but will provide Business Vendors and Users with a seven-day advance notice.  
Site Availability: We are not liable for interruptions in Site availability due to maintenance or other events beyond our control. We strive to inform you of planned or existing availability restrictions, schedule downtime outside of peak hours, and limit maintenance-related downtime to reasonable durations consistent with market standards.  
Confidentiality in Our Relationship 
Both parties may share Confidential Information, which refers to any sensitive information regarding one party's business, Transactions, or other non-public information. Neither party will disclose the other’s Confidential Information except to affiliates, employees, agents, or professional advisors who need to know it, are legally bound to confidentiality, and will use it solely for fulfilling obligations under these Business Terms. The recipient may disclose Confidential Information if required by law, provided reasonable notice is given to the other party when legally permissible.  
Publicity Restrictions: You are prohibited from making any public statements regarding the relationship established in these Business Terms without our prior written consent, except as required by law with reasonable notice to us.  

Handling Personal Data
Joint Data Controllers: Business Vendors and Dedw3n function as joint controllers when processing personal data, which includes any information that can identify an individual, such as name, date of birth, address, or email address. The handling of this personal data and our respective responsibilities are detailed in the Joint Controllership Agreement attached to these Business Terms.  
Independent Data Processing Activities: Both Business Vendors and Dedw3n may engage in data processing activities independent of one another. Each party is responsible for complying with data protection laws (particularly the General Data Protection Regulation) when conducting these independent activities, and Business Vendors agree to refrain from processing personal data in a manner that violates Dedw3n's Terms & Conditions or these Business Terms.  
Privacy Policies: If required by applicable data protection or privacy laws, Business Vendors must maintain their own privacy policy, detailing how Users can reach them with privacy-related inquiries or concerns. Any terms regarding data protection within Business Vendor Policies must clearly differentiate between Dedw3n's personal data processing activities and the Vendor's independent activities. If we conduct independent data processing activities, we will adhere to our Privacy Policy.  
Ending Our Relationship

Assignment of Rights: We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Business Terms to another organization, with a 30-day prior notification. Should you disagree with this transfer, you may terminate these Business Terms immediately by deleting your Business account. If you wish to assign your rights and obligations under these Business Terms to a third party, and such assignment may impact Users' rights, both parties must inform Users in a timely manner before the assignment takes effect.  
Continuation of Terms After Termination: Upon termination of these Business Terms, they will remain in effect until all pending Transactions and Payouts are completed.
